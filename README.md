## Question

Create a web page to display the details about any country the user searched for.
The page should have a search field.
Initially, the page should show the search field and list of country names sorted alphabetically.
 - Based on the search term, render the details of the countries.
 - The details of the country page should contain basic functionalities (example: there    must be a google map preview and on click, it should navigate to google maps).
Required data on the page - Country Name, languages spoken, geographic location, Flag(img). You can also form a short description based on the contents you get from the API.
 - The remaining data can be displayed based on your interest
